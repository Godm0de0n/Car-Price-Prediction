# Car Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts car prices based on various attributes using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of multiple car features, and the model estimates the price based on these attributes.

## ✨ Features
✔ Data preprocessing and cleaning  
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✔ Feature engineering and selection  
✔ Model training and evaluation  
✔ Performance metrics and visualization  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
🔹 Python  
🔹 Jupyter Notebook  
🔹 Pandas, NumPy  
🔹 Scikit-Learn  
🔹 Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 🚀 Installation
1️⃣ Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2️⃣ Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Car_Price_Prediction
   ```
3️⃣ Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📖 Usage
1️⃣ Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2️⃣ Run `Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb` step by step.

## 📊 Dataset
Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory before running the notebook.

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated based on:
✔ Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
✔ Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
✔ R-squared Score (R²)  

## 🔥 Future Improvements
